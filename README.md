# üé≤ C# Beginner & Intermediate Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner and intermediate-level C# projects based on 
[The Coders Cat's YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9ah7DDtYtflgwMwpT3xmjXY9) 
‚Äî a great resource for learning C# fundamentals through hands-on practice.

## üìö About

I'm using this playlist to build and reinforce my understanding of core C# concepts by building small, 
focused projects. This repository will evolve as I work through each tutorial, starting from the basics 
and gradually incorporating more intermediate topics.

## üéØ Goals

- Strengthen my understanding of C# syntax and logic
- Practice object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Gain hands-on experience with Visual Studio and the .NET ecosystem
- Get comfortable using Git and GitHub for version control
